      During my time in the high school, one of the assignments we had to do was to make a 2D game in unity as groups.
  <br> <br> The game was about a bird trying to avoid a toxic mist to live longer, and the longer the bird lives, the higher the score would be. The game also gave a competitive feeling with the high score system that was in the game.
      <br> <br> This project certainly taught me a lot, mostly about all the difficulties that game developers go through when making a game, and how a single line of code can break the game

       Cyber Security has always been one of my interests. In fact, it was my top interest before Artificial Intelligence became
          a widely available public technology.
          <br><br>
          Learning about cyber security would me to stay more secure on the Internet. And while it is true that no one is always a hundred percent safe, it's always better to have caution.
          <br><br>
          Which is why I tend to be interested in learning more about the field of cyber security

    As I mentioned in the previous section, Cyber security was my top interest before Artificial Intelligence.
    I believe that with the progress that artificial intelligence has taken in the past few years. It would help humanity
    reach new advancements way quicker than without it.
    <br><br>
      And it's because of this rise of artificial intelligence in the past few years that has interested me in researching and learning more in this area, and I believe that it will greatly benefit me in the long term.

       <p>My previous interests were mostly about technology and technological advancements, but a good majority of my interest is in the world around us.
       <br><br>
       As a kid, I really didn't care about the world around us, but as I grew up, the idea that the universe is so large that it's hard for humans to grasp really interested me in wanting to learn more about the universe.
         It's the idea that the universe is incredibly large that drives people to discover more, and to advance in technology to be able to discover more even faster. It's the correlation between technology and the world around us that makes it beautiful.

          </a>
          <p>
            Suprisingly, I never really liked physics courses, in fact, I hated it.
            <br><br> I never liked the idea of simply memorizing formulas and this ended up costing me a lot of valuable information. Speaking of valuable information, the information that has been the most valuable and interesting to me has been the speed of light and how it's the speed limit of the universe.
            <br><br> The main reason I got interested in physics, goes back to my interest in astronomy that rose when I grew up. Having knowledge about things like physics, chemistry and biology can even save lives, and not having these information might end up costing lives in certain scenarios or sitautions.
